A random stock selector dedicated to the great community of [r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)

## Purpose
Have you ever wanted to start investing but couldn't decide what stock to pour your life savings in to? Then wsb-rand-stock is the product for you.

No more TSLA calls. No more PLTR calls. Put all your money in a random stock and [perform better than the S&P500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSGm9DDQ3o&ab_channel=Node14)

Honestly, I couldn't find a random stock generator that I truly loved. So I decided to make my own. 

## How it works
- Uses [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and market data CSV files to fetch information on a random stock from a specific market & sector
- Graphs are generated with [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com/)


## TODO
- Tracked in issues

## Acknowledgment
Some of the backend python code was greatly inspired by the [get-all-tickers](https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers) library made by [Shile Wen](https://github.com/shilewenuw)
